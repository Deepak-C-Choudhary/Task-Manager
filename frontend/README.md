Here's a detailed `README.md` file for your React Task Manager app:

```markdown
# React Task Manager App

A full-stack task management application built with **React** for the frontend, **Node.js** and **Express** for the backend, and **MongoDB** for data storage. The app allows users to create, view, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed.

## Features

### Task Management
- Create tasks with a title and description.
- View a list of all tasks.
- Mark tasks as completed (cannot re-mark already completed tasks).
- Edit task details (title and description).
- Delete tasks.

### Data Persistence
- Tasks are stored in a MongoDB database and retrieved dynamically.

### Validation
- Ensures task titles are not empty.
- Prevents marking tasks as completed multiple times.
- Graceful error handling with user-friendly error messages.

---

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React (with npm for package management).
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js.
- **Database:** MongoDB (MongoDB Compass for visualization).
- **Tools:**
  - `npm start` for running the frontend.
  - `npx nodemon` for running the backend.
  - `mongod` to start the MongoDB database.

---

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
1. **Node.js**: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.
2. **MongoDB**: Install MongoDB and ensure the `mongod` service is running.
3. **npm**: Comes with Node.js for managing dependencies.

### Steps to Run the Application

#### Backend Setup
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_name>
   ```
2. Navigate to the backend folder and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npx nodemon
   ```
   The backend runs on `http://localhost:5000`.

#### Database Setup
1. Ensure the `mongod` service is running:
   ```bash
   mongod
   ```
2. Use MongoDB Compass (optional) for managing and viewing data.

#### Frontend Setup
1. Navigate to the frontend folder:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the React application:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The frontend runs on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

1. Open the frontend at `http://localhost:3000`.
2. Use the interface to:
   - **Add Tasks**: Enter a title and description, then click "Add Task".
   - **View Tasks**: View the list of tasks with their status.
   - **Mark Completed**: Click the "Complete" button for pending tasks.
   - **Edit Tasks**: Click the "Edit" button, modify details, and save changes.
   - **Delete Tasks**: Click the "Delete" button to remove a task.

---

## Code Structure

### Backend
- **`server.js`**: Main entry point for the Express server.
- **`routes/`**: Contains route definitions for handling API endpoints.
  - `taskRoutes.js`: CRUD operations for tasks.
- **`models/`**: MongoDB schema for tasks.
  - `Task.js`: Mongoose schema for task documents.
- **`middleware/`**: Custom middleware for validation and error handling.

### Frontend
- **`src/`**: React application source code.
  - **`components/`**: Reusable UI components (e.g., `TaskList`, `TaskForm`).
  - **`App.js`**: Main component managing routes and state.
  - **`api/`**: Functions for interacting with backend APIs.

---

## Key Features & Decisions

- **Validation**: Ensures task integrity with backend validation.
- **RESTful API**: Followed REST principles for API design.
- **Data Persistence**: Tasks are saved and fetched dynamically from MongoDB.
- **UI Design**: Focused on user-friendly interfaces and responsiveness.

---

## Error Handling

- **Validation Errors**: User inputs are validated to prevent invalid data submissions.
- **Database Errors**: MongoDB connection issues are handled gracefully.
- **API Errors**: HTTP responses include clear error messages and status codes.
- **Frontend Errors**: Includes alerts and prompts for guiding users.

---

## Future Enhancements

1. **User Authentication**: Add login and signup functionality.
2. **Task Prioritization**: Allow users to assign priority levels to tasks.
3. **Search and Filter**: Enable searching and filtering tasks based on status or priority.
4. **Deployment**: Host the application on cloud services like Heroku or Vercel.
